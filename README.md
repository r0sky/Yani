# Yani
A twitter bot that reads the content of the shared link and answers your question.

Especially news and content sites; Twitter pages that arouse curiosity and waste our time by giving the link instead of sharing very short information that can be transferred with 280 characters..
There are some popular twitter pages created to avoid these annoying clickbait and waste of time. Two of them are @bosunatiklama and @LimonHaber.
However, these accounts cannot respond to the content of every news page, so they cannot meet the demands of dozens of followers. Because account holders need to read and write content or retweet other volunteers' posts.
The aim here is to automate this work and any user can get the answer to their question by tagging the bot.
The bot answers the question by mentioning it publicly, so anyone who thinks about a similar question can see the answer under the original tweet.
